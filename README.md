SmartPark: AI-Powered Parking Fee Management System

With increasing urban congestion and the growing need for automation in public services, managing vehicle parking efficiently has become essential. Our project introduces SmartPark, an AI-based Parking Fee Management System that leverages camera detection and smart payment technologies to offer a seamless parking experience. The system aims to eliminate manual intervention, reduce time, and ensure transparency in vehicle parking and billing.

SmartPark utilizes AI-powered cameras to detect vehicle number plates upon entry and exit. The system automatically records the entry time, identifies the vehicle type (2-wheeler or 4-wheeler), and checks for slot availability in real time. If space is available, a slot is allocated, and the vehicle is allowed to enter.

On exit, the system once again scans the number plate, retrieves the entry time from the database, and calculates the parking duration and fee. A digital receipt is generated showing a breakdown of the billing. The user can then choose from two payment methods: UPI or Wallet. For wallet users, the amount is directly deducted from their preloaded balance after login.

Additionally, the system provides a user module where individuals can create an account, register their vehicle, and maintain a digital wallet. The wallet system ensures faster payments and improves overall user experience. A staff interface is also included to supervise and confirm payments when needed.

This smart system ensures faster turnaround, reduced manpower, and offers a scalable, intelligent approach to managing parking lots.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an AI-powered automated parking fee management system. The goals include:

(1) Automated Vehicle Detection and Entry Logging
To detect vehicle number plates using AI and log entry time without manual input.

Implementing camera-based AI detection to identify license plates.

Classifying the vehicle as a 2-wheeler or 4-wheeler.

Checking and assigning an available parking slot from the database.

(2) Efficient Exit and Fee Calculation
To automate the billing process based on parking duration.

On exit, use camera detection to identify the vehicle again.

Retrieve entry details and compute the total duration.

Apply fee rules based on vehicle type and duration.

Generate a digital receipt showing calculation details.

(3) Smart Payment Integration
To offer convenient and quick payment options to the user.

Support for UPI-based payment through QR code or link.

Wallet-based system allowing registered users to pay directly from balance.

Ensure wallet balance updates and payment confirmation.

(4) User Account Management
To allow users to manage vehicles and wallet through a secure platform.

User registration with vehicle ID and personal details.

Option to view transaction history, balance, and top-up wallet.

(5) Staff Oversight and Monitoring
To support human supervision when necessary.

Staff interface to confirm payments, handle disputes, and manage operations.

Dashboard showing current parked vehicles and payment status.
